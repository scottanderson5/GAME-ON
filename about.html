					The idea for GAMEon was born with two foundations in mind: discovery and opportunity.
					</p>
					<p>
					Through discovery, gamers would have a chance to find and experience new board and card games they may have never heard of. 
					</p>
					<p>
					For game developers, they have the opportunity to market and receive feedback on their products.
