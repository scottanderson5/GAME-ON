					One central idea behind the creation of GAMEon was discovery and anticipation. With that in mind the user is asking to be sent a random game from one of our partners. 
					</p>
					<p>
					However, to get a better idea of what the user may be looking for (and not to leave you completely in the dark) we ask that you answer some simple questions so we can send a game to you based on your needs.
					</p>
					<p>
					Questions such as age range and number of players are important to make sure that we don't send you a game which will not work for you. For example, a game for 2-4 people will not work if you are hoping to play something with 8 people. And we also would not want to send you a game more geared toward kids if your group is over the age of 18.

					Your experience and feedback will be crucial towards the games potential success! Our partners are looking forward to hearing your feedback so that they may know what works, or doesn't, with their products.
